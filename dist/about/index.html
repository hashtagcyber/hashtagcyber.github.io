<p>Learn more about my background, expertise, and professional journey.</p>
<h2 id="professional-summary">Professional Summary</h2>
<p>I started my career in the US Army, starting as a Systems Engineer, promoted to Engineering Manager, and then later selected to help form the Cyber Protection Brigade as a Security Engineer. Those first 10 years of my career taught me a lot about leadership, project management, and how to build a team that succeeds in a resource constrained environment.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to dive deep into software and security engineering challenges at tech companies like Facebook and Amazon, and apply the things I learned there at smaller companies that need both technical skills and thoughtful leaders.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-get-out-of-bed">Why do I get out of bed?</h2>
<p>“Bosses” and “Managers” are a dime a dozen. The world needs more Leaders. My favorite memory about every role I’ve ever had is the moment that things “clicked” for the team…</p>
<ul>
<li>They have someone to support them.</li>
<li>They are on a team where our shared belief is “if you take care of the people, the people will take care of the business”.</li>
<li>The team we built together is the best team they’ve ever been on, and they will strive to take our values with them wherever they work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="professional-experience">Professional Experience</h2>
<p>On a resume we share “what we’re proud we accomplished”… but what I love talking about the most is “the things I learned there”.</p>
<h3 id="head-of-security">Head of Security</h3>
<p><strong>rabbit inc. • 2024 - Present</strong>
<br>I learn something new almost daily here… so my “favorites” change regularly. For now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile Device Security (Hardware and AndroidOS), from the manufacturer’s lens</li>
<li>AI Agent Development and the security challenges that it brings</li>
<li>Business Development and Sales Engineering</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="director-of-security-engineering">Director of Security Engineering</h3>
<p><strong>NielsenIQ • 2022 - 2024</strong>
<br>This was a new one for me; until this point, the engineering teams I supported were trying to balance speed and availability with little concern for cost. At NIQ, customers cared more about accuracy and cost than anything else. This led to my discovery of design patterns I’ve never seen (or had to secure) before.</p>
<ul>
<li>I added a new carrot to my feedbag here, “if you do it securely, it will be cheaper”</li>
<li>I learned about the Scaled Agile Framework here, and absolutely love it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="director-of-security-engineering-1">Director of Security Engineering</h3>
<p><strong>Zip Co • 2022 - 2022</strong>
<br>There is a stereotype in the engineering community that “everything cool is built on GCP or AWS”. Zip was the first place I worked where most of the infrastructure was on Azure. And the design was… impressive. This was my first (non-military) experience discussing security strategy and results with a board of directors on a regular basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>We adopted a modified Eisenhauer Matrix:
<ul>
<li>“How fast will it kill the company”</li>
<li>“How long will it take to fix”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Zip Data Org set a new standard for me when it comes to “build a team that everyone wants to be on”. Their monthly TV news style updates ensured that everyone at the company knew what they were working on.s</li>
<li>Selfless service still applies in the business world:
<ul>
<li>We went through a re-org, and the right decision for both the company and the people I supported was for me to build an execution plan (and budget) that no longer included me.</li>
<li>I was sad to leave (I joined to work with my favorite CISO), but it felt really good to know that they were left with a strong plan for the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cloud-security-tech-lead">Cloud Security Tech Lead</h3>
<p><strong>Grubhub • 2020 - 2022</strong>
<br>
Grubhub was the perfect mix of “engineering excellence” and “move fast”. It’s where I learned to consider “is this something I am going to pour concrete around”.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to deploy bot protection without shutting down the business or randomizing all of engineering</li>
<li>Met my favorite cross-functional partners… our legal and fraud teams.
<ul>
<li>Kathleen opened my eyes to new business risks I had never considered, and shutdown a lot of misconceptions we have in the security world</li>
<li>Todd showed me 101 different ways to steal from an e-commerce platform, significantly upleveling my ProdSec knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="senior-security-engineer">Senior Security Engineer</h3>
<p><strong>Facebook, CERT • 2018 - 2020</strong>
<br>Every experience here made me better; a better leader, a better engineer, and even a better person. Part of Facebooks benefits package included <a href="https://www.lyrahealth.com/">Lyra</a>, which made connecting with a quality psychologist easy. This is where a realized, “you have no shame getting a personal trainer to uplift your physique, getting a therapist to train your brain is the same thing”. (No, this isn’t an ad for Lyra, I just wish more companies had a service like theirs)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Onboarding</strong>: If I had unlimited budget, I would replicate every part of the onboarding experience here. I don’t… so I pull out the most valuable pieces wherever I go
<ul>
<li>Bootcamp Tasks: Use a jira label for backlog items that anyone should be able to perform, but haven’t yet been prioritized. This lets a new hire land commits as soon as possible</li>
<li>XFN Demos: It’s fairly easy to learn the role YOUR team plays in an org; but without intentional effort, it takes time to learn what the other teams do. Make this part of onboarding. “My team is X, you should ask us for help with Y”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Endpoint Protection</strong>: “I don’t care what you do on your laptop as long as it isn’t illegal” - I’m slightly paraphrasing here, but that was the opening statement of the security briefing we received. If you’re in an unregulated industry, your time is better spent looking for legitimate threats vs acting as the internet usage nanny.</li>
<li><strong>Engineering</strong>: Surrounded by world-class software engineers, you level-up your code quality VERY quickly. This was the place that set the standard for me when it comes to “security engineers should be … engineers”.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-engineer">Security Engineer</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon, FINSEC • 2017 - 2018</strong>
<br><em>If Amazon charges money for it, we have a hand in it’s security</em>. Alejandro showed us that the best way to get budget for a program is to deliver results that people want, and then deliver a plan for how to achieve those results regularly. Learning how to “write like an Amazonian” has forever changed my career.</p>
<h3 id="security-instructor">Security Instructor</h3>
<p><strong>Chiron • 2016-2017</strong>
<br> Teaching is my passion, and this is where I realized that I can much more impact by teaching a room full of students than by securing one network after another.</p>
