# Developing Mitigations with the STRIDE Approach

When it comes to application security, the STRIDE/DREAD hybrid threat model is one of the most powerful tools available for software development teams. STRIDE/DREAD combines two crucial security approaches: a combination of threat modeling techniques and risk management strategies. This powerful combination gives developers the ability to assess and identify their application’s security risks and develop effective mitigations to protect the application from potential threats.

The goal of the STRIDE/DREAD hybrid threat model is to help software development professionals identify, analyze, and mitigate their application’s risks. The acronym itself stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), Elevation of Privilege (EoP), Authorized Data Access (ADA), Network Access, and Data Integrity (DI). These nine categories refer to different types of threats that an application can encounter. By using these categories to assess a given application and create appropriate mitigations, developers can ensure that their applications are secure against common threats. 

In order to apply the STRIDE/DREAD approach in an effective manner, developers need to first understand how the individual elements work together. Each element of the hybrid threat model refers to a particular type of security risk or attack vector. For example, threats associated with Spoofing are those that take advantage of weaknesses in authentication systems or relay false information. Similarly, threats associated with Tampering involve altering data or code in an unauthorized way. 

Once developers have identified possible threats for a given system, they can use the STRIDE approach to develop appropriate mitigations. For example, if a system is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, developers can implement strong authentication measures such as two-factor authentication or biometric security measures. If a system is vulnerable to tampering attacks, developers can use encryption or digital signatures for data integrity checks. Developers can also take steps such as ensuring proper database security and access control protocols are in place in order to protect against data disclosure or DoS attacks. 

Finally, by combining STRIDE’s threat modeling approach with DREAD’s risk management strategy, developers can evaluate their overall risk level and develop appropriate measures to reduce it. For example, if a system is highly vulnerable to information disclosure attacks due to weak database access controls or inadequate input validation checks, developers may decide it’s worth investing in better security controls even if those controls are expensive or time-consuming to implement. 

The STRIDE/DREAD hybrid approach is an invaluable tool for any software development team that wants to ensure their applications remain secure against common threats. By understanding how each element works together and applying appropriate countermeasures based on the risks identified through this approach, developers can rest assured that their applications will remain secure against common attacks.
