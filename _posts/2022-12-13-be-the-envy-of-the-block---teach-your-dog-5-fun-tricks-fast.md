# Tricks to Teach Your Dog
There’s nothing quite like having a loyal and obedient pup at your side. If you're looking to add a few new tricks to your pup’s repertoire, here are some simple commands and activities you can teach your dog: 

## 1. Teach Them How to Greet You 
Your pup can learn how to greet you the same way every time you come home. They can either sit beside you when you walk in, lay down in front of you, or give their paw for a shake. 

## 2. Teach Them How to “Stay” 
Learning the command “stay” is an important one for your pup - it’ll help keep them safe and out of trouble when they’re off-leash. Start with a rewarding treat and lots of verbal praise when they stay perfectly still. Then, gradually work on increasing the length of time they stay and adding distractions that they must ignore before they get their reward. 

## 3. Teach Them How to Find Hidden Treats 
Hide treats around your house or yard, then give your pup hints like “go get it!” or “search!” as encouragement until they sniff out their reward. This activity will help keep them engaged and entertained while helping them build up their problem-solving skills. 

## 4. Teach Them How to Spin 
This trick is actually pretty easy to teach – all you need is a few tasty treats and your pup's favorite toy. Place the treat in front of them and then point at it with the toy, encouraging them to spin in circles with verbal praise until their reward is gone. After a few repetitions, your pup will be spinning around on command! 

## 5. Teach Them How to Follow a Moving Target 
Attach a long rope or line of tape around two poles that are several feet apart from each other – this will create an “obstacle course” for your pup to complete. Have someone move between the two poles while calling out commands like “follow me!” or “this way!” so that your pup can practice following a moving target. This will help them learn how to focus on responding quickly and accurately even in distracting environments. 

By learning commands like these, not only will your pup be more obedient and well
