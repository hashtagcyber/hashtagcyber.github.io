# Identifying and Classifying Threats Using STRIDE/DREAD

As a software developer, it's critical to keep in mind the potential vulnerabilities in any system you create. In order to do that, you need to understand why these threats exist, how to identify them, and how to manage them properly. In this chapter we will discuss how to apply the STRIDE/DREAD hybrid threat model to software development.

## What is STRIDE/DREAD? 

STRIDE/DREAD - short for what stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege - is a hybrid approach to threat modeling. It is based on the DREAD model but be aware of the other threat categories that are included in it. Performing a STRIDE/DREAD analysis involves taking a step back and examining the application from an attacker’s perspective by considering all potential threats that could arise from flaws in a system’s design.  

Based on these criteria, the threats are sorted and classified in three different levels: Catastrophic Threats (DREAD score 9-10), High-Risk Threats (Score 6-8), and Medium-Risk Threats (Score 3-5). 

## Identifying Threats 

When it comes to identifying threats with STRIDE/DREAD, you should consider each of the six threat categories, as well as their associated risks. You should consider both external (for instance threats presented by malicious actors) and internal (for instance unintentional user input) sources when listing out your potential threats. Once potential threats have been identified within each category of STRIDE/DREAD, they should then be organized into groups so that each group can have its risk quantified based on DREAD scale. 

## Assessing Risk 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 		  
Once you have a list of potential threats in your software project, it’s time to assess their associated risks according to each category of the DREAD scale. The rating for each threat should be based on factors like the ease with which it could be exploited by an attacker or implemented by an insider; if any real damage would be caused if this were exploited; and what countermeasures are available in order to prevent or reduce its potential risk. All of these assessments should be documented separately for future reference and hazard mitigation activities.  

## Managing Risk 
  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	   
Now that you know the level of risk associated with each threat within your software system, you can begin thinking about approaches and steps to reduce or eliminate the likelihood that the threat could become realized. This might involve adding additional security measures or additional layers of authentication within the system; establishing policies and plans for disaster prevention; developing targeted training programs for users on secure computing practices; or simply raising awareness among stakeholders about potential risks within your project. Whatever strategy is chosen needs to match up with the assessed risk level from earlier in order to truly address the problem at hand effectively. 

Lastly it’s important to remember that security is an ongoing process – new risks will emerge as time passes so regularly assessing their level of risk is important for businesses who want to maintain their reputation as leaders in secure systems. By following this process of identification, classification, assessment and management you can ensure your software projects are well secured against any challenges they may face due to malicious actors or unintentional user input.
