# Identifying Further Steps for Securing Software Development

The STRIDE/DREAD hybrid threat model is an incredibly useful tool for understanding and mitigating threats to software development. It plots a path forward with two simple but interrelated concepts: STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) and DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability). 

Using STRIDE and DREAD is a great first step in securing software development. But there are other steps that can be taken to help secure software and the networks it runs on. Here we will discuss a few of those steps to help identify further action that can be taken. 

## Establishing Robust Authentication 
The first step in securing software development is making sure that there are robust authentication methods in place. This means ensuring the passwords on all user accounts are sufficiently long and complex enough that they cannot be easily guessed or cracked. In addition to this, organizations should consider using other methods of authentication such as two-factor authentication or biometric measures like retinal scans or fingerprint recognition. These measures can provide an additional level of security that can help protect against threats such as Spoofing (Impersonation) identified by STRIDE. 

## Implement Software Patch Management  
Software patch management is another important step in securing software development. All software should be periodically checked for updates and fixes to address potential vulnerabilities that have been identified by security researchers. If security patches become available, they should be promptly installed which will help mitigate threats such as Tampering (modifying the original code) and Elevation of Privilege (gaining access to areas of the system that are typically not accessible). 

## Monitor Network Traffic  
Monitoring network traffic is also essential when securing software development. This includes keeping track of who is accessing what parts of the system as well as what type of data (if any) they are transferring out of the system. Through this process it can help to identify malicious actors attempting to steal data or cause damage to the system which would fall into the realm of one or more threats identified by STRIDE such as Repudiation (refusal to acknowledge a transaction took place), Information Disclosure (unauthorized disclosure of confidential data), Denial of Service (preventing authorized users from accessing services or resources) and Elevation of Privilege (gaining unauthorized administrative access rights). 

## Test Systems Periodically   
Finally, it's important to test systems periodically using tools such as fuzz testing and penetration testing which can help uncover weaknesses in the system security architecture. This type of testing is especially important when dealing with unknown threats in order to identify potential risks that may not have been included in the STRIDE/DREAD hybrid model such as new forms of malware or exploits previously unseen in production environments. 

By taking these additional steps, organizations can better protect their software development projects against various types threats identified by STRIDE and DREAD while also identifying new ones as they emerge. Doing so will ensure that their software and networks remain secure while also keeping their customers' data safe and secure against malicious actors.
