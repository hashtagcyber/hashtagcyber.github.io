# Applying Damage Potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability Scoring Systems

Software development is an ever-evolving landscape. As new technologies emerge and methods of attack become more sophisticated, it's important for software developers to stay ahead of the curve and proactively protect their project from potential security threats. 

One way to do this is by incorporating a threat model into your development process. The STRIDE/DREAD hybrid approach concerns itself with evaluating risks based on the potency of a vulnerability's five primary attributes — Damage Potential (D), Reproducibility (R), Exploitability (E), Affected Users (A), and Discoverability (S).  By rating each attribute on a scale from 1 to 10, you can begin to gain an understanding of the potential impact of a given security threat. In this chapter, we'll take a closer look at how to use this scoring system in your software development workflow. 

## Damage Potential
Damage Potential (D) is defined as the sum total of exposure and damage caused by exploiting a security loophole. This could include both economic damage and disruption to service or data theft — depending on the type of threat we're facing. To determine a score for D, the most common approach is to weigh intensity against scale: if a threat has high intensity but impacts relatively few users, then its D score may be lower than that of a threat with low intensity but massive scale potential. 

## Reproducibility
Reproducibility (R) determines how consistently and repeatably a security vulnerability can be triggered in various scenarios. A vulnerability that is easily reproducible across different conditions would likely have an R score higher than one which is tricky to activate consistently.  That said, it's important not to overestimate reproducibility — even if something looks easy to trigger repeatedly, there still could be some underlying complexity which could lead to unexpected issues in production. 

## Exploitability 
Exploitability (E) describes how difficult or simple it is to exploit a given security hole. There are two main factors which will come into play here: complexity, i.e., knowledge required in order to take advantage of the loophole; and technical means, i.e., tools available for making use of the vulnerability itself. Both should be taken into consideration when determining an appropriate E score for any given threat. 

## Affected Users 
Affected Users (A) evaluates how impactful the security bug would be if triggered across multiple users of the service or application in question. It's important for software developers to keep in mind that the risk isn't just limited to customers — any employee user accounts accessing sensitive information could be vulnerable too! A bug which requires user authentication would likely score lower than one which can be triggered via anonymous access; but either way, it's important to factor all possible affected users into your calculations when evaluating A scores. 

## Discoverability 
Discoverability (S) measures how hard or easy it is for malicious actors to find and exploit the vulnerability in question. Knowledgeable attackers usually have access to various resources such as bug bounties and public databases where they can uncover lurking vulnerabilities — but even something seemingly basic like strong passwords still require effort in order to discover them properly! When setting an S score for any given security gap, consider both readily available information as well as passive scanning which may require more dedicated effort on part of attackers in order to find an existing weakness.

 By taking Damage Potential (D), Reproducibility (R), Exploitability (E), Affected Users (A), and Discoverability (S) into account when assessing potential threats against your software development project, you can give yourself greater situational awareness and implement preventive measures before attackers are able to cause harm!
