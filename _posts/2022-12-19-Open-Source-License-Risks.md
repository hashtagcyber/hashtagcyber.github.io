# The High Cost of Free: Why Some Open Source Licenses Aren't Worth the Risk for Companies

As software engineers, we know the value of open source software. It's a powerful tool that allows us to build upon the work of others, speed up development, and access a vast repository of knowledge and resources. However, as with anything, there are always trade-offs. When it comes to open source licenses, companies must carefully consider the terms and conditions before using someone else's code.

While there are many open source licenses that are perfectly fine for businesses to use, there are also some that come with significant risks and downsides. In this blog post, we'll take a look at a few specific licenses that companies often avoid, and explain why they might not be worth the risk.

## The GPL License

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a popular open source license that has been around since 1989. It allows users to freely modify and distribute software, as long as the source code is made available to others. Sounds great, right?

Well, not exactly. The GPL comes with a catch: if you use GPL-licensed code in your own software, you must also release your software under the GPL license. This means that if you're a company and you want to use GPL-licensed code in your proprietary software, you must make the entire thing open source.

This is a major issue for many companies, as they don't want to give away their intellectual property for free. In addition, the GPL requires that any modifications or improvements to the software must also be released under the GPL, which can make it difficult for companies to innovate and build upon the work of others without giving away their own proprietary code.

## The AGPL License

The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is a variant of the GPL that is specifically designed for software that is used over a network (such as a web application). Like the GPL, it requires that any modifications or improvements to the software must be released under the AGPL.

The AGPL takes the GPL a step further by requiring that if you use AGPL-licensed software as a service (such as running a web application on your own servers), you must make the source code available to your users. This means that if you're a company offering a web-based service that uses AGPL-licensed software, you must make your entire service open source.

Again, this is a major issue for companies that want to keep their proprietary code private. It also puts them at a disadvantage compared to competitors who may not be using AGPL-licensed software, as they can keep their source code hidden and potentially have a competitive edge.

## The LGPL License

The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is another variant of the GPL that is designed to be more permissive. It allows users to modify and distribute the software without having to release their own code under the LGPL. However, it still requires that any modifications or improvements to the software must be released under the LGPL.

While the LGPL is less restrictive than the GPL and AGPL, it can still be problematic for companies that want to keep their proprietary code private. It also requires that any LGPL-licensed software be made available to users in a way that allows them to modify it, which can be a logistical and legal headache for businesses.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while open source software can be a valuable resource for businesses, it's important to carefully consider the terms and conditions of the licenses used. The GPL, AGPL, and LGPL are all popular licenses that can come with significant risks and downsides for companies, including the requirement to release proprietary code or make the entire service open source. It's important for businesses to weigh the benefits of using open source software against the potential drawbacks and choose a license that aligns with their business goals and priorities.
