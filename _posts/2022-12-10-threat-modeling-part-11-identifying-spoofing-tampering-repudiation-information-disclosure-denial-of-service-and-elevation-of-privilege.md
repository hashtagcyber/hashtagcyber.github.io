# Identifying Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege with STRIDE/DREAD Hybrid Threat Model 

Using the STRIDE/DREAD hybrid threat model to identify various security threats that could potentially be present in software can help ensure that your application stays secure while it remains operational. This chapter explains how to use the model to identify specific threats and potential mitigation strategies for them. 

## Spoofing 

Spoofing is one form of attack that involves misrepresentation in order to gain access to something or to cause damage. In terms of the STRIDE/DREAD hybrid threat model, spoofing is addressed by the “S” (Spoofing) and D (Damage Potential) components. The “S” should mitigate any attempts of a user impersonating another identity, while the “D” scores the potential harm a successful spoofing attack could cause. 

For example, if an attacker were to successfully spoff as a trusted user or system process and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, a high “D” score would be warranted. To mitigate this threat, authentication should be robust and varied, with multiple layers of assurance when possible. For example, passwords could be combined with 2-factor authentication for added security. 

## Tampering 

Tampering is when an attacker attempts to make malicious changes to applications or data without authorization. In terms of the STRIDE/DREAD hybrid threat model, tampering is addressed by both the “T” (Tampering) and “R” (Repudiation) components. The “T” should anticipate any attempts by an attacker to manipulate data while the “R” will score the potential harm that could result from an attack succeeding in doing so. 

For example, a hacker might try to insert malicious code into an application or modify records in order to create financial disputes afterwards. A high “R” score would reflect this threat as it could easily lead to losses in revenue or damage in reputation. A unique hash value should be created for each piece of data tracked by the application in order to detect any malicious attempts at tampering with it. Also ensuring data integrity with digital signatures can help prevent attackers from making changes without authorization. 


## Information Disclosure 
Information disclosure is when information that should otherwise remain confidential is revealed through unintended means. In terms of the Stride/Dread hybrid model, this is addressed by both the “I” (Information Disclosure) and “D” (Damage Potential) components. The “I” should anticipate any attempts by an attacker to gain access to sensitive information through illegal means and assesses these threats accordingly. The D will then score how much harm could be caused if successful access is attained. 

For example, if someone were able to bypass authentication protocols and gain access to a customer database containing personal Identifiable Information (PII), you'd want a corresponding high “D” score as this would mean significant losses in revenue if not appropriately addressed. To mitigate this level of risk you'd want proper implementation of encryption protocols throughout your application stack as well as regular password reviews and rotation policies - ensuring they remain complex while making sure they don't become too easily guessable by attackers over time. 

 ## Denial of Service & Elevation of Privilege 
The denial of service (DoS) attack occurs when an attacker floods an application with requests so it has difficulty responding to legitimate requests from customers - leading it to crash or become slow in responding. Elevation of privilege occurs when an attacker gains access rights higher than their own by exploiting weaknesses in system configurations or user management processes - allowing them unauthorized access that can lead to serious system breaches. 

In terms of the Stride/Dread hybrid model both DoS attacks & elevation of privilege addresses are addressed by both the "D" (Damage Potetial) & "R" (Repudiation) components respectively. For DoS attacks causing outages or slowdowns can have significant impacts when considering reputation damage - making sure a suitable high "D" score is applied is important here while also making sure controls are put into place like rate limiting requests where possible so attackers can't cause too much disruption at once during prolonged attempts at flooding applications with requests - leading them to crash or becoming slow due unprocessed user input being sent past its limit before being processed properly..  
   For elevation of privilege potentially allowing access to parts restrictd sections such as customer databases marked private, making sure multiple layers authenticationn protocols such as password plus 2-factor authentication are implemented throughout your stack will help reduce he amount risks posed here - also performing regular reviews on user management processes such tyshould would go ahng wayif properly implemented & followed correctly averting potential exploits looking for easier ways into other parstof systejsare sursnf their intended users' purposes will help improve overall security for yur operations greatlyt& see su enough assessement scored suitablyhie .
